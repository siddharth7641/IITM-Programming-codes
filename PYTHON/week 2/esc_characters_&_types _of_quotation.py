'''escape cahracters are widely used for escaaping different situations and lines in python
 whenever we use quotaion under any quotation 
 print('helllo's world')
 it'll gives ERROR so we put a backslash(\) before the quotetaion  '''
print('helllo\'s world')
print("I am from \"IIT\" Madras")

#to prove tab space while printing we write \t 
print('my name is siddharth, \t I\'m from Rohtak.')

#to print output or sentence in next line we use \n
print('I\'m  doing dual-degree. \nBCA and BS in Data Science and Application')

#To give string's value in different lines we use triple quote rather than double or single quote 
x='world'
y='beauutiful'
z='''this 
world is 
not beautiful 
anymore'''
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
