/*Maps - Employee Sales Target
Write a Java program that, given as input the names of employees in an insurance company and the policy sales target achieved by each of them in 3 consecutive months, prints the names of those employees who have achieved at least 10 in all the months.

Class Company has/should have the following members:
Private instance variable Map<String, ArrayList<Integer>> employeeMap (maps the employee name to the list of the sales target achieved by them in each month).
A constructor to initialize the instance variable.
An accessor method to access the instance variable.
Class FClass has the following members:
A method getFinalList() that takes an object of class Company as input and returns the list of employee names who have achieved at least 10 in all the months.
main() method does the following:
Accepts inputs to instantiate an object of Company. The input is accepted in the order â€” employee name followed by the list of their policy sales targets.
Invokes method getFinalList() to get the list of employee names who have achieved at least 10 in all the months.
Prints the list returned by the method getFinalList().
What you have to do
Define method getFinalList() of class FClass.
